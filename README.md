<h1 align="center"> LLDB: Efficient Low-light enhancement with Difffusion Bridge </h1>

This paper investigates a method for solving low-light image enhancement problems based on the diffusion bridge framework. Currently, low-light enhancement tasks still face challenges in noise removal and detail recovery, and existing diffusion model methods suffer from slow speed and large parameter counts. We conducted an in-depth study of the diffusion bridge theory, integrating its advantages and employing a nonlinear activation network to further improve the low-light enhancement task. Additionally, we used a Gamma correction module for fine-tuning low-light images, significantly improving performance with almost no extra computational cost. Experiments show that Low-Light enhancement with Difffusion Bridge (LLDB) far surpasses other methods on the LOLv1, LOLv2-real and LOLv2-syn datasets.
